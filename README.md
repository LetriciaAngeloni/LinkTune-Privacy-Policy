# LinkTune Privacy Policy
**Last updated:** July 24, 2025

## Data Collection
LinkTune does not collect any personal information about you or your usage patterns. The app operates entirely on your local device.

## Clipboard Monitoring
LinkTune monitors your clipboard to detect URLs for automatic cleaning. This data includes:
- URLs copied to your clipboard
- Detection of tracking parameters and URL components
- Automatic cleaning based on your preferences

All clipboard monitoring happens locally on your Mac and is never transmitted to our servers or any third parties.

## Data Storage
Any data that LinkTune stores (such as your app preferences and launch-at-login settings) is saved locally on your device using standard macOS storage mechanisms. This data never leaves your Mac.

## URL Processing
LinkTune processes URLs entirely on your device to remove tracking parameters, protocols, and other unwanted components based on your settings. No URLs are sent to external servers for processing.

## Third-Party Services
LinkTune does not use any third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking services. We do not integrate with social media platforms or external data services.

## Data Sharing
We do not share, sell, or transmit any data about you or your usage to third parties. There is no data to share because we don't collect any.

## Changes to Privacy Policy
If we make any changes to this privacy policy, we will update this page. Since LinkTune doesn't collect data about you, we have no way to notify you directly of changes.
